Deep ConvolutionalArchitectures refer to neural network architectures specifically designed for processing structured grid-like data,
such as images. They use convolutional layers that perform convolutions, applying filters to capture local spatial dependencies in the 
input data. These architectures are successful in computer vision tasks like image classificaton, object detection and image segmentation.
They often consist of stacked convolutional layers followedby fully connected layers for high-level reasoning and classification.
Deep Convolutional Architectures have revolutionized computer vision and enable the automatic learnig of hierarchical represantions
from raw image data.
